# DIV Evolution Activity

This repository contains a step-by-step progressive activity for exploring the capabilities of the HTML `<div>` element—from basic structure to advanced visual and interactive use cases.

## 📚 Structure

Each folder contains a standalone `index.html` file that demonstrates one step of the evolution. You can open each file directly in your browser.

### 🔹 Step 1 – Basic DIV
A minimal example showing a raw `<div>` element.

### 🔹 Step 2 – Visible DIV
Styles are added to make the `<div>` visible and recognizable as a layout element.

### 🔹 Step 3 – HTML Attributes
Demonstrates the use of basic HTML attributes like `id`, `class`, `title`, and `tabindex`.

### 🔹 Step 4 – CSS Advanced
Shows how to enrich a `<div>` using external styles, gradients, transitions, and hover effects.

### 🔹 Step 5 – Data & ARIA
Introduces `data-*` attributes and ARIA roles for accessibility and richer semantics.

### 🔹 Step 6 – JS Interaction
A clickable `<div>` that changes style dynamically using JavaScript.

### 🔹 Step 7 – Rich Media
An example of a visually enhanced "hero" section using a background image, typography, and layout styling.

## 🧑‍🏫 Intended Use

This activity is designed for creative coding classes and workshops. Each step can be discussed and modified in real-time to encourage experimentation with structure, style, and behavior.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open each folder and run `index.html` in your browser.
3. Modify the code and observe changes live.
